Website developed for Carnegie Financial Services.

Website developed using Spring Boot Framework with MYSQL as database. Front end developed in HTML5, CSS3 along with bootstrap.

Website was developed as an exercise for the Web Application Developement project during my Master's program. Along with myself contributors to the project include my team mates  Xinlu Zhang, Ji Wang, Anqi Li, and Mo Sriha

For development a different repository was used which has been made private by Carnegie Mellon University. This is the backup repository.
